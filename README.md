# Non_Existing_Person_Creator

A python script for saving many photos of people who don't exist (made up data for a project).
This uses Nvidia "This Person Does Not Exist" website to save many photos of people who don't exist in specific file locations for fake data. I changed the format to .jfif as i needed a smaller image size to store in a SQL database.

# downloads

Use "pip3 install requests" to install requests and "pip3 install pillow" for the PIL image editor.
